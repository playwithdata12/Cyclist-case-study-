Analysis using python

I worked on case study 1 that is How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success

In order to answer the questions, I followed the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.

Background:

So cyclist is a  bike-share company in Chicago.It has a  bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with
disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.

Earlier, Cyclistic's marketing strategy tried to build general awareness and appeal to broad consumers. It has flexible pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. It divided customers into two types that is casual and members.
Casual riders →Those who purchase single-ride or full-day passes.
Members-->Those who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic 

My Role: In this scenario I am a junior data analyst at Cyclistic and my team has been tasked with the overall goal (see below) of designing marketing strategies. 

Goal: To design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members

Solution:

The bike company can give bonus points for each ride to the member user. Bonus points can be accumulated to secure free rides. Hopefully this would aim to see an increase in number of rides and also member subscriptions.
We also see that casual users are more active on weekends so we lower weekend rates for member users to encourage them to use rides on weekend too and this will also encourage causal riders to become member subscribers.
Discounts can also be given e.g. may be after every 5 miles or 5% to 10% after 10 minutes of ride.
